# finalCapstone
#This is a program of an inventory management system.
#This is a capstone project on object-oriented programming (OOP) for my software engineering bootcamp.

#The program reads in a 'inventory.txt' file with a list of stocks with their product name, code, storing location, cost and quantity 
#The program prompt the users to perform stock management tasks and save changes to the 'inventory.txt' file.

#The management systems supports the following functions:
#1 - View all inventory
#2 - Allowing the user to add a new product into the inventory list
#3 - Allowing the user to search for a product using the product code
#4 - Find the product with the lowest quantity and allowing the user to restock
#5 - Find the product with the highest quantity, suggest to the user that this product could be on sale
#6 - Automatically calculate stock value (cost * quantity) for each product and produce report on screen

#The project is developed on python and does not require installation other than ensuring python is available on your machine
#However, please ensure that the complimentary 'inventory.txt' file is saved to the same directory as the python script

#Special thanks to HyperionDev for providing the software engineering bootcamp
